## ðŸ“š What I Learned
Through this project, I learned the fundamentals of React: Components, Events, and State, while creating a functional shopping cart with quantities, prices, and more. This project is an iteration of the [original GuitarLA](https://github.com/AimarBustamante/guitar-la), but with the code written in TypeScript. I also gained a foundational understanding of TypeScript through this project.
